### **💭 My thoughts on this project:**  
This is my **fourth project**, and for a beginning, I'm proud of it! 🎉  
- It took me **2 days** to build the backbone of the program.  
- I spent **8 days in total** learning and battling with my perfectionnism and some problems with reportlab.

It was a great learning experience, especially for my understanding of **Streamlit**, **Reportlab** and **my problem-solving skills**.

💡 My strengths: Determination, self-taught mindset and curiosity.

🚀 Areas for improvement: Code and visualization optimization, and my perfectionnism.

### **💭 Possible Remake of that LEVEL:**  
I’m planning a future remake with:
- Adding a model for prediction
- Improve the quality of the reports
- Adding a model to clean datasets
- And lots of possible features.

"More advanced versions will come soon... Stay tuned."
